[4:3mProving a renderer[4:0m

A file with many RakuDoc components and some idea about what is expected.


[21m[1mSYNOPSIS[22m[24m
Assuming a new renderer has been developed and installed (eg using [3mzef[23m) at [1mRakudoc::To::MyRender[22m, the render this file using a [7mraku --rakudoc=MyRenderer[27m terminal command. The renderer will be consistent with the RakuDoc v2 specification if all the blocks are rendered appropriately, and warnings are generated by the statements marked as incorrect below. 



[21m[1mPurpose[22m[24m
This file is intended to prove a RakuDoc v2 renderer. It can be used in several ways: 

 • to generate the AST representation of all the RakuDoc components in the specification
 • to prove a renderer that a new renderer should be able to process this file
 • to visualise how the final output of a RakuDoc source will look after processing
An attempt has been made to utilise all RakuDoc components, it is not an exhaustive test of all components in all possible combinations. Please suggest additional combinations if they turn out to have unusual effects. 

Several [3mmistakes[23m have been included where the RakuDoc v2 specification indicates how inconsistent behaviours or unknown components should be handled. 

The the end of the rendering of this source file, a number of warning messages should be included.

Various entities are possible such as « or the same thing using unicode «. Entities can be double unicodes, such as 🇺🇦, which is the Ukrainian flag. 

In case you have forgotten, here is something aliased at the start: Do not consider this a disquisition of possible combinations. 

This is an example of an Alias where A<DECLARATION> was replaced by the contents of the =alias directive. Aliases are scoped, see below, but cannot be specified before being used in the document. Here is an undeclared forward reference, which was written as A<an undeclared|XXX>. The use of an undeclared alias causes a warning. 

We can also make an inline [1mdefinition[22m. This whole paragraph will be referenced later. 

A developer note [48;5;216m[38;5;0mcan be attached[39;49m[38;5;161m[48;5;17m highly deprecated[39;49m[38;5;196m[48;5;17m[for v1.2.3 ^.. v2.0.0][39;49m to text. A renderer may show the text or only show it for contexts compliant with the version. 

But a note without meta no versioning here is ignored and a warning generated. 

When we want a formula [7m\sum \frac{1}{n^{2}} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{6}[27m use F<> markup. 

Links can be made internally [48;5;227m[38;5;0msay to the first heading[39;49m[this page: [38;5;227m[48;5;0mThis_is_a_first_heading[39;49m] or externally [48;5;227m[38;5;0msay to the raku documentation site[39;49m[internet location: [38;5;227m[48;5;0mhttps://docs.raku.org[39;49m]. 

A renderer should provide the opportunity to customise text using M<...|..,..;...> markup. The renderer [7mshould not recognise this functionality[27m and issue a warning. 

A note [48;5;214m[38;5;0m[1][39;49m will not itself be rendered inline, but the text will be rendered in a footnote or popup. A marker or number will be rendered to point to the text. 

Suppose we want to place the definition [1mIm-a-doppelganger[22m
⦗We can also make an inline [1mdefinition[22m. This whole paragraph will be referenced later. 


⦘ here. And to confound pedants, here is a definition [1mHappy[22m

Normally extra spaces are removed with paragraphs, but sometimes we truly dot dot dot   dash dash dash       want them. 

Good text will contain [7melements to be placed[27m in an index. The index has already been placed at the start of the document, although content is generated here.

Unnumbered up to four levels of bulleting are required, a renderer can offer more. 

 • The start of a unnumbered item list

to put space between lists, probably a [7m=para[27m without text is needed.

The project originally consisted of five phases, of which two are already complete and two have been abandoned: 

 ☑ Investigate existing solutions
 ☑ Define a minimal initial feature set
 ☐ Implement this minimal set of features
 ☒ Secure 100 million in venture capital
 ☒ Abscond to the Bahamas with the cash
The major sources of sustainable energy are: 

 🌍 wind
 🌍 hydroelectric
 🌍 solar
 🌍 geothermal
 🌍 fusion
  🤞 (eventually)
